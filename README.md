As urban centers are becoming increasingly more populated and congested, the management of public parking places, according to local mobility policies, is a key strategic issue with high economic impact. Academia and industry are well aware of the potential gains that can be obtained taking advantage of information and communication technologies applied to this field. An efficient smart parking system will favor drivers, by reducing the time to find a parking place and by optimizing parking spaces’ utilization rate, thus increasing the revenues for the urban parking operators.
The importance of applying the adequate strategy for the management of parking places can also be found in the estimate that during the day a typical vehicle stays in idle 95% of the time.
The driver’s behavior, when choosing the type and the location of the parking place as well as making the final decision, depends on many factors and represents a considerably more complex process, which should be paid much more attention than before. The usage of advanced technologies is unavoidable in achieving selected combination of strategies.
A simple coding and design pattern has been used to automate the browsing through the parking lots, checking out empty spots, finding out whether it is available for advance booking, and fare. 
Features -
 Login Register: Users and parking lot owners can register into the portal and will be allowed to browse through the list of places-> parking lots-> parking spots 
 Current Booking: Users can check out the availability of empty spots currently and book the spot immediately.
 Future Booking: If a user needs an advance booking, he can do so by booking the car/bike from a fixed time to a fixed time.
