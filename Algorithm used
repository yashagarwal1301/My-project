Distance of nearest cell:-
Given a binary matrix of N x M, containing at least a value 0. The task is to find the distance of nearest 1 in the matrix for each cell. The distance is calculated as |i1 – i2| + |j1 – j2|, where i1, j1 are the row number and column number of the current cell and i2, j2 are the row number and column number of the nearest cell having value 0.
Approach: The idea is to traverse the matrix for each cell and find the minimum distance, To find the minimum distance traverse the matrix and find the cell which contains 0 and calculates the distance between two cells and store the minimum distance.
STEP 1. Traverse the matrix from start to end (using two nested loops)
STEP 2. For every element find the closest element which contains 0. To find the closest element traverse the matrix and find the minimum distance.
STEP 3. Fill the token number in the matrix.

Sparse Matrix:-
A matrix is a two-dimensional data object made of m rows and n columns, therefore having total m x n values.
2D array is used to represent a sparse matrix in which there are three rows named as :
Row   : Index of row, where non-zero element is located
Column: Index of column, where non-zero element is located
Value : Value of the non zero element located at index – ( row, column )
